The brief was to build a solution to a bootcamper problem. It was vital that we were pragmatic with our approach in order to complete the Mid-term project (week 8). For technical skills we used HTML, CSS and javascript, other skills included the ability to think calmly under pressure in order to meet the brief in the short timeframe. We collaborated to ideate, design, build and demo a product within a week. This provided the first experience of writing questionnaires to correctly define the problem and generate User Personas. I enjoyed making a product that was relevant and followed a brief whilst tackling the problems that were amplified because of a short time frame. In this project I was involved in the back-end primarily, and as one of our stretch goals I was pleased to be able to structure the files using the MVC pattern. I received feedback from my team that I had shown strong leadership skills and excellent communication throughout the week.
